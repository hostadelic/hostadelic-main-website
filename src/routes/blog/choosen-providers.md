title: 'Choosen providers'
excerpt: 'We took a lot of care choosing providers for our community works. They had to not be pricey and… possibly free!'

Every one of the various customers ech one of us may have features its own set
of providers. Some may come more often than not (Okta, Splunk, Azure…) and some
less (Duo, Loki, Scaleway, whatever…)

For our own projects we sat on those below.

## Cloudflare

Cloudflare is like a global startup program. Well, when it comes to the hosting
costs. You still have to find early employees and find a way to offer them
compensation of course.

But still, they've got so many free services, choosing them is a must.

- `Pages` is free static website hosting behind a worldwide CDN.
- `Workers` is free API with Fetch and cache support to get your other cloud
  vendors resources if not present.
- DNS, DDOS protection…

## Migadu

For a very fair pricing you have as many domains and mailboxes you want under a
true email hosting, so aliases catchalls and whatnot.

It's not free it's just paying for what you cost them and a little more.

## Auth0

They have the most comprehensive authn / authz platform so far. Including an
hosted login form.

They have docs, they support IdP / ID tokens to integrate to portals if you do
an SaaS etc.

Their only drawback so far is they've been acquired by Okta.
